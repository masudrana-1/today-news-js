                <h1>What is the difference Between var, let, and const in JavaScript?</h1>
                <p>The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
                    Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                    Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
                    accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                    Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope
                    to the immediate enclosing block.</p>

                <h1>What is The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions?</h1>
                <p>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more
                    concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow
                    functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.</p>
                <h4>1. Syntax</h4>
                <h4>2. Arguments binding</h4>
                <h4>3. Use of this keyword</h4>
                <h4>4. Using new keyword</h4>
                <h4>5. No duplicate named parameters</h4>

                <h1>What's the difference between map, foreach, filter and find?</h1>
                <p>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the
                    array
                    and it returns undefined.</p>
                <p>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                    elements.</p>
                <p>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new
                    array
                    with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
                <p>Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail —
                    this
                    function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function
                    will
                    return the first that has matched.</p>

                <h1>Why we use template string in JavaScript?</h1>
                <h4>Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The
                    method is called string interpolation.</h4>
                <p>Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line
                    strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called
                    tagged templates.

                    Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most
                    commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).
                    However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag
                    function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.</p>
